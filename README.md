# rebecca-portfolio

Site is live at www.rebecca-sullivan.com, deployed on Heroku.

Originally built in Java and Spring, I re-built my portfolio site in a different look, now using Bootstrap for styling.

I built this site around the structure of the buzzword bingo project, since I had a Node.js app up and running. Since then, I built a blog using the Contentful API. The site is built using Node, Express, Handlebars, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and some vanilla JavaScript.
