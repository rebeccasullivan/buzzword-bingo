			<p>As Director of Marketing, I led a team of 3 to create a strategy 
			for improving online sales of salon gift certificates for a company that operates salons 
			within retirement communities. We first charted the existing customer journey for a specific 
			target audience segment (adult children of community residents, who often make purchasing 
			decisions on behalf of their loved ones) and the ideal customer journey. Our team made 
			recommendations on a broad, strategic scale, and then broke them down into attainable, 
			tactical, short-term goals in the midst of a redesign of the company&#39;s online sales platform.

			<p>As part of a team of 4 in a Marketing Value Creation class, we developed 
			an overarching brand plan for an up-and-coming women&#39;s clothing retailer, based in LA. Our 
			final deliverable included an overview of the major industry factors influencing the company, 
			the brand&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, an analysis of the brand&#39;s major competitors, perceptual 
			mapping to determine ideal positioning, recommendations for new messaging, two target 
			audience personas along with a customer journey map for each, and our final brand-building recommendations.

			</div>
			<p>As part of a Corporate Reporting & Analysis class in the Accounting department, I 
			worked with 3 Masters of Accountancy students in providing a valuation for Merck & Co., a Fortune 500 
			pharmaceutical company. Our analysis started with broad strokes, including a dive into the business environment 
			and industry factors affecting the company. It then narrowed in on accounting ratio analysis and a comparative 
			performance assessment of the company&#39;s past 5-year financials. We developed various sales growth forecasting 
			scenarios and provided a few different valuations accordingly, including using the DCF method and residual earnings method.

			</div>
			<p>As part of a team of 5 Weatherhead MBA students, we performed an in-depth analysis and evaluation 
			of RPM International, a multinational holding company and manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. Our report 
			provided a forecasted valuation of the firm, based on a review of the company&#39;s history and its current state. The 
			financial analysis included a ratio analysis, net sales growth, and a qualitative analysis of the key influencing factors 
			on the firm&#39;s overall performance. We relied on historic financial data, investor relations and marketing materials, and 
			a meeting with a contact made at the firm.
