				<p>As Director of Marketing, I led a team of 3 to create a strategy 
				for improving online sales of salon gift certificates for a company that operates salons 
				within retirement communities. We first charted the existing customer journey for a specific 
				target audience segment (adult children of community residents, who often make purchasing 
				decisions on behalf of their loved ones) and the ideal customer journey. Our team made 
				recommendations on a broad, strategic scale, and then broke them down into attainable, 
				tactical, short-term goals in the midst of a redesign of the company&#39;s online sales platform.

				<p>As part of a team of 4 in a Marketing Value Creation class, we developed 
				an overarching brand plan for an up-and-coming women&#39;s clothing retailer, based in LA. Our 
				final deliverable included an overview of the major industry factors influencing the company, 
				the brand&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, an analysis of the brand&#39;s major competitors, perceptual 
				mapping to determine ideal positioning, recommendations for new messaging, two target 
				audience personas along with a customer journey map for each, and our final brand-building recommendations.

				<p>As part of a Corporate Reporting & Analysis class in the Accounting department, I 
				worked with 3 Masters of Accountancy students in providing a valuation for Merck & Co., a Fortune 500 
				pharmaceutical company. Our analysis started with broad strokes, including a dive into the business environment 
				and industry factors affecting the company. It then narrowed in on accounting ratio analysis and a comparative 
				performance assessment of the company&#39;s past 5-year financials. We developed various sales growth forecasting 
				scenarios and provided a few different valuations accordingly, including using the DCF method and residual earnings method.

				<p>As part of a team of 5 Weatherhead MBA students, we performed an in-depth analysis and evaluation 
				of RPM International, a multinational holding company and manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. Our report 
				provided a forecasted valuation of the firm, based on a review of the company&#39;s history and its current state. The 
				financial analysis included a ratio analysis, net sales growth, and a qualitative analysis of the key influencing factors 
				on the firm&#39;s overall performance. We relied on historic financial data, investor relations and marketing materials, and 
				a meeting with a contact made at the firm.
