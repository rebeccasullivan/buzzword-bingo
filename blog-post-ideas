I will preface this post with a disclaimer that at Hyland, we're particularly spoiled in that we get a lot of leeway in the onboarding process. Even on my consulting team, where we're measured by our weekly utilization rate (the number of hours we bill), we're still given a cushion in ramping up those hours as we shadow other team members and get acclimated to projects. 

That being said, the transition out of the safe bootcamp cocoon and into being responsible for troubleshooting production code as the sole developer on a project was not an easy one. I hear these sentiments echoed by many fellow grads and junior devs - people seem to agree that the first 3-6 (or even more) months in your first dev job can certainly be invigorating, but it can also be overwhelming and frustrating.
