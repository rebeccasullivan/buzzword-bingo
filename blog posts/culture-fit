Plenty of articles are written about an employer recruiting for culture fit,
but not as many for candidates finding it.

Once you find it, you're more productive, you get more out of your career

Figuring out early whether a company's values align with yours
Asking the right questions (interviewing your interviewer)
Understanding what leverage you have

Wrong culture fit is damaging to the company and the employee

Employee:
- Negative spiral of feeling demoralized and under-valued
- Negative emotions toward company
- Disengaged and distracted - looking for other jobs
- Vindictive - will only give as much as required instead of going
above and beyond

Company:
- Hiring costs of finding a replacement - extend to lost productivity and
opportunity cost (they could've hired the right person to begin with)
- Can be contagious, causing other employees to be disengaged
- Can be damaging to customer relationships
